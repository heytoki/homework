            Hi I'm Hitoki, I like reading, playing games, and petting my dogs until they get bored.
            I hate physical activities, waking up early, and speaking with people.
            My primary language is English, but I can also fluently speak Japanese.
            I can't read or write in Japanese, but my speaking is indistinguishable to a native speaker.
            My favorite food is BBQ and generally dislike most vegetables, especially mushrooms.
        </p>
        <section id="games"><em>Games!</em></section>
        <p>
            I generally play all sorts of games that my friends invite me to play, but I do play on my own too.
            FPS, MMO, MOBA, RPG, soul-like, really anything. My favorite would probably be either
            a Korean MMO called Lost Ark, or League of Legends. 
        </p>
        <section id="books"><em>Books!</em></section>
        <p>
            I enjoy reading all sorts of genre of books, and science articles; anything that catches my eyes.
            I usually read something simple like manga or novels. Recently reading a manga called Frieren: Beyond Journey's End

            I went to SFU and took some computer science courses so Python, Java, and C shouldn't be too bad,
            but it has been a while so I may have forgotten a bit. This Github account is also my personal account with a
            python script to automate a certain game's process.

        <p>
            Recently I have been into Linux. I got a new laptop for school and work purpose, and installed linux.
            It has a lot of customization capabilities which I really like. I would change my PC to linux if it weren't
            for how limiting the games I can play on it is. It does not have good compatibilities with Kernel Level Anti Cheats
            which my two main games uses.
