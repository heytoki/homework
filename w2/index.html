            HTML is the content of the webpage. It utilizes CSS and JS to make the webpage look
            more neat. <br/>
            Below is an example of HTML code which creates a clickable link with the text
            "favorite website" that redirects you to https://mozilla.org/
            <img src="element.png"><br/>
            Most IDEs support HTML but VS Code is the most popular free option many uses.
            It is not limited to VS Code but emmet.io helps a lot in writing HTML. <br/>
            <code>! + enter</code> creates a default HTML start which is really helpful!

            CSS is the styling sheet used in HTML. CSS is the most popular choice of style sheets
            but there are many alternatives out there.<br/>
            Below is an example of h1 (header type one) having a font color red and font size of 5em.

        <section id="js"><h2>JavaScript</h2></section>
        <p>
            JavaScript, commonly know as JS is a popular webpage programming language. We have not yet
            started on learning JavaScript however it is very different from HTMl, CSS and commonly
            confused with Java.<br/>

            I am not 100% sure but the above looks to be an example of a button that shows a popup
            on the browser that asks for a name.
